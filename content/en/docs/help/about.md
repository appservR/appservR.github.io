## Why this project?

There are already some alternatives to deploy R Shiny apps:

* [shinyapps.io](https://shinyapps.io)
* [Shiny server](https://www.rstudio.com/products/shiny/shiny-server/)
* [ShinyProxy](https://www.shinyproxy.io/)

and maybe some others.

However, working in an organization where data is not the primary focus and with limited IT admin resources (100% Windows!), I found no easy way to share Shiny apps internally as proof of concept.

AppservR is intended as a solution for simple deployment with limited admin resources, without conceding performance.

Also it was a fun project to start with the Go programming language during COVID-19 lockdowns weekends.
