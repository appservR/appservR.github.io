## Requirements

AppservR runs your Shiny apps using your system install of R. You need to have R installed on your system to use it. You will also need the ```shiny``` package and all other R package your app needs. [Learn more about Shiny â†’](https://shiny.rstudio.com/)

{{< alert icon="ðŸ’¡" text="Make sure first that you are able to run your Shiny app properly using R/Rstudio." />}}

## Download & Install

Get the latest AppservR executable for your platform on our [Github releases page](https://github.com/appservR/appservR/releases). You will need to chose your download option from the "Assets" section of a specific release.

To install, just uncompress the archive at a location of your choice.  

## Run

AppservR is a command-line program with a web graphical user interface. Most settings can be configured using only the web interface, which means that you do not need to have access to the server to configure a new Shiny app, for instance.

Start a terminal window in the directory where AppservR executable lives and then type:

``` bash
./appservR serve 
```

Go to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080). You should see a running sample app (the classic Shiny's *Old Faithful Geyser Data*, with a twist). If not, see below.

## Configure

 AppservR will look for *Rscript* executable at the default install location for your platform. If it is installed 

Create a new site, change directories, install dependencies, and start development server.

### Create a new site

Doks is available as a child theme, and a starter theme:

- Use the Doks child theme, if you do __not__ plan to customize a lot, and/or need future Doks updates.
- Use the Doks starter theme, if you plan to customize a lot, and/or do __not__ need future Doks updates.

Not quite sure? Use the Doks child theme.

#### Doks child theme

```bash
git clone https://github.com/h-enk/doks-child-theme.git my-doks-site
```

#### Doks starter theme

```bash
git clone https://github.com/h-enk/doks.git my-doks-site
```

### Change directories

```bash
cd my-doks-site
```

### Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### Start development server

```bash
npm run start
```

Doks will start the Hugo development webserver accessible by default at `http://localhost:1313`. Saved changes will live reload in the browser.

## Other commands

Doks comes with commands for common tasks. [Commands â†’]({{< relref "commands" >}})
